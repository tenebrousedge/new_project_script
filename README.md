# new_project_script
This script creates a basic bootstrap site via bower

## Usage

* clone the repo somewhere `git clone https://github.com/tenebrousedge/new_project_script ~/new_project_script`
* run the script via `~/new_project_script/repo_init.sh` (yeah yeah inconsistent naming)

If that's too much to type, you can add the folder to your $PATH:
```shell
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/new_project_script/
```

My startup script will set this up for you, so you can run the startup script and then be able to type `new_project` anywhere.
